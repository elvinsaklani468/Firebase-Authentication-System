## 📖 About the Project  
With rising **cyber threats**, securing user accounts is more critical than ever.  
This project presents an **advanced login authentication system** that enhances security while ensuring a **seamless user experience**.

✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for added security  
✅ **Adaptive Authentication** to detect suspicious activities  
✅ **User-friendly interface** for easy login  
✅ **Secure password management** for stronger credentials  
✅ **Firebase Database Integration** for securely storing user credentials
